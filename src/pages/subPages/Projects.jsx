                                <p className="text-sm text-gray-300">This project is a custom-built monitoring system designed for ANANTARA Hotel, using Nagios Core to provide real-time tracking of IT infrastructure including servers, network devices, and critical services. The system features a modern, web-based dashboard that displays performance metrics, system health, and alerts in real time. It also includes an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to interact with the system using natural language to query status and receive updates.

The platform automatically generates alerts when performance thresholds are breached and logs all events for troubleshooting and audits. Role-based access control and secure authentication ensure data protection. By shifting from reactive to proactive monitoring, this solution helps IT teams reduce downtime, respond faster to issues, and maintain a more stable infrastructureâ€”all through an intuitive and accessible interface.</p>
